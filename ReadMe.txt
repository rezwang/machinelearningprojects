Here is a list of my experience in machine learning projects using Python and scikit:

1- Loading datasets
	a) Pen-Based Recognition of Handwritten Digits Data Set: A digit database by collecting 250 samples from 44 writers. The samples written by 30 writers are used for training, cross-validation and writer dependent testing, and the digits written by the other 14 are used for writer independent testing 
	b) The Iris flower data set or Fisher's Iris data set is a multivariate data set introduced by Sir Ronald Fisher (1936) as an example of discriminant analysis.
2- plot_digits_classification: Recognizes images of hand-written digits from a dataset of 1797 8x8 images (1.a) (Suppervised Vector Machine, SVM).
3- newsgroups_text_classification: A dataset of 18000 newsgroups posts on 20 topics (unsupervised)
4- plot_color_quantization: Performs a pixel-wise Vector Quantization (VQ) of an image, 
reducing the number of colors from 96,615 unique colors to 64, while preserving the overall appearance quality 
(Unsupervised, Clustering, KMeans algorithm).
5- model_persistance: saves the model (SVM and pickle)
6- plot_randomly_generated_classification_dataset: Plot several randomly generated 2D classification datasets
7- plot_iris_dataset: 3D plot of trainign data sets consists 50 samples of 3 different types of irises
8- plot_decisiontree_regression: Fit 1D regression with decision tree and predict and plot the outcomes (Desicion tree algorithm, 1D regression)
9- plot_decisiontree_regressor_multioutput: multi-output regression with decision tree (Decision tree, multi output, regression)
