Here is a list of my experience in machine learning projects using Python and scikit:

1- Loading datasets
2- plot_digits_classification: Recognizes images of hand-written digits (Suppervised Vector Machine, SVM)
3- newsgroups_text_classification: A dataset of 18000 newsgroups posts on 20 topics (unsupervised)
4- plot_color_quantization: Performs a pixel-wise Vector Quantization (VQ) of an image, 
reducing the number of colors from 96,615 unique colors to 64, while preserving the overall appearance quality 
(Unsupervised, Clustering, KMeans algorithm).
5- model_persistance: saves the model (SVM and pickle)
