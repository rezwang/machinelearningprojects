Here is a list of machine learning projects writien in Python
* Public datasets in svmlight / libsvm format: http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvmtools/datasets/
* Faster API-compatible implementation: https://github.com/mblondel/svmlight-loader

1- Loading datasets
2- plot_digits_classification: Recognize images of hand-written digits
3- newsgroups_text_classification: The 20 newsgroups dataset comprises around 18000 newsgroups posts on 20 topics split in two subsets: one for training (or development) and the other one for testing (or for performance evaluation). The split between the train and test set is based upon a messages posted before and after a specific date.
4- plot_color_quantization: Performs a pixel-wise Vector Quantization (VQ) of an image, reducing the number of colors required to show the image from 96,615 unique colors to 64, while preserving the overall appearance quality.
